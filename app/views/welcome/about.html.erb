          <p>
            Upon graduation from the University of South Carolina, I decided to buy a one way ticket to Colorado - that was three years ago. Living the ski bum life in Vail for two years has me trading my sundresses and cowboy boots in for beanies and flannel.  My perfect day would be spent frolicking in the mountains, getting my heart rate up on a good hike, and ending the day with beer and friends.
